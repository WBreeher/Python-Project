12-Month “God-Tier Entry-Level Dev” Roadmap
Phase 0 – Prep (Weeks 0–2) CLEARED

Goal: Set up environment and tools.

Tasks:

Install Python, VS Code (or PyCharm), and Git

Set up GitHub account for portfolio

Install Jupyter Notebook

Outcome: Ready to start coding with version control set up.

Phase 1 – Python Fundamentals (Weeks 3–10)

Goal: Master core Python concepts.

Topics:

Variables, data types, loops, conditionals

Functions, modules, classes/objects (OOP basics)

Lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples

File I/O and exception handling

Practice:

Small scripts: calculator, to-do list, text-based game

Daily coding exercises (HackerRank, LeetCode easy)

Outcome: Solid Python foundation.

Phase 2 – Version Control & Git (Weeks 11–12)

Goal: Professional code management.

Tasks:

Learn Git: clone, commit, push, pull, branches, merge

Host all projects on GitHub with clear README

Outcome: Portfolio looks professional; recruiters notice.

Phase 3 – APIs & Integration Skills (Weeks 13–18)

Goal: Connect Python programs to external services.

Topics:

REST APIs using requests

JSON parsing and handling

Automation scripts using APIs (weather, stock tracker, Twitter bot)

Practice:

Build at least 1 project using an API

Document and upload to GitHub

Outcome: Recruiter-ready real-world project.

Phase 4 – Python Libraries for AI/ML (Weeks 19–28)

Goal: Hands-on with core AI/ML libraries.

Libraries:

numpy, pandas → data handling

matplotlib, seaborn → visualization

scikit-learn → basic ML models

Optional later: torch / tensorflow for neural networks

Practice:

Mini ML projects: linear regression, text classification, sentiment analysis

Upload at least 2 projects to GitHub

Outcome: Recruiters see applied AI/ML skills.

Phase 5 – Build Small VI Prototype (Weeks 29–36)

Goal: Combine skills into a mini VI (like Jarro).

Tasks:

Chatbot with NLP (transformers, nltk)

Optional: TTS with pyttsx3 or ElevenLabs API

Simple memory module (store previous conversations)

Outcome: Working VI prototype for portfolio/demo.

Phase 6 – Advanced Python/AI Concepts & Interview Prep (Weeks 37–44)

Goal: Refine skills for interviews.

Topics:

Problem-solving with algorithms (LeetCode easy-medium)

Modular OOP design, clean code practices

Package projects and write unit tests

Practice:

Mock interviews

Explain your projects clearly and confidently

Outcome: Ready to ace junior dev interviews.

Phase 7 – Portfolio & Networking Push (Weeks 45–52)

Goal: Land interviews and stand out.

Tasks:

GitHub: 4–5 polished projects (chatbot, API integration, ML mini-projects)

LinkedIn: weekly progress posts, highlight projects

Apply to 5–10 jobs/week, tailoring resume + cover letter

Network in dev communities (Reddit, Discord, Twitter)

Outcome: Recruiters notice your portfolio; first offers start coming in.

Expected Results After 12 Months

Portfolio: 4–5 solid projects demonstrating Python + AI/ML + API/integration

Skills: Confident coding, basic ML models, API integration, mini VI prototype

Interview Readiness: Able to handle junior Python/AI developer interviews

Rejection Rate: Minimized due to tangible projects, polished portfolio, and professional presentation
